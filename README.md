# Casual Foundry Technical Test

This is my delivery on the technical test send by Casual Foundry. I would like to thank once again for their interest in my profile. This project has been developed in an afternoon of time, in around 6 to 8h.

In order to run the project please make sure to install all needed dependencies first by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

or if you use `Yarn` :

```sh
yarn install
```

You will also need a `.env` file on the root directory of the project. Here are the variables you will need:

```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=6754ff41aa3675c36ca15e542b83922b
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_URL=//api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
```

Once all the environment is set, simply run one of the following commands depending on your package manager:

```ph
npm run start

yarn start
```

You can check the `package.json` file for additional scripts in case you need them.
